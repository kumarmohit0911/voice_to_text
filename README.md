# Transcription Script README

## Overview
This Python script performs audio transcription using the AssemblyAI API. It uploads an audio file, transcribes it, and retrieves the transcription results.
## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:
- An AssemblyAI API key (stored in `api_secrets.py` as `API_KEY_ASSEMBLY`).
- Python installed on your system.
## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install the required dependencies (if any) using `pip install requests`.
3. Run the script with the audio file you want to transcribe as an argument (e.g., `python transcribe_audio.py my_audio.wav`).
## Code Explanation
Let's break down the script:

### 1. Uploading the Audio File
The `upload` function:
- Reads the audio file in chunks.
- Sends the chunks to AssemblyAI's upload endpoint.
- Retrieves the upload URL for the audio file.

### 2. Transcribing the Audio
The `transcribe` function:
- Creates a transcription request with the audio URL.
- Posts the request to AssemblyAI's transcription endpoint.
- Retrieves the job ID for the transcription.

### 3. Polling for Transcription Completion
The `poll` function:
- Periodically checks the transcription status using the job ID.
- Returns the transcription data when completed or an error message if there's an issue.
## Example Usage
```bash
python transcribe_audio.py my_audio.wav
